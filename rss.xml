            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light painting with pixelstick</h1><p>More info at thepixelstick.com! We spent the last year building pixelstick, a light painting tool capable of everything from photo-real renders to amazing abstract ribbons. We've improved with every iteration and are excited to finally show off what it can do. Everything was shot by just two slightly sleep deprived guys and one Pixelstick in Brooklyn.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f83450408b8ae969aa617e22dc894484/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F481060213_1280x720.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rising dawn: Rolls-Royce debut handsome new soft-top.</h1><p>The Rolls-Royce Dawn made its debut in an underground car park, just a stone's throw from Wallpaper's HQ. Granted, it was the car park beneath Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners' award-winning Neo Bankside development, and the other bays were full of Ferraris, Maseratis and other exotic metal.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4e9722ec934a561a202db1ac3eff4119777420ed.jpg"></article>]]></description>
