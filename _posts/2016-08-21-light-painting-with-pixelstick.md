  More info at thepixelstick.com! We spent the last year building pixelstick, a
  light painting tool capable of everything from photo-real renders to amazing
  abstract ribbons. We've improved with every iteration and are excited to
  finally show off what it can do. Everything was shot by just two slightly
  sleep deprived guys and one Pixelstick in Brooklyn.
